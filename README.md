# Weather-Dashboard

This application can be accessed at https://hsuzach.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/.

The goal of this assignment was to create a responsive Weather Dashboard through the use of API's. The API used in this project was https://openweathermap.org/api.

With the use of OpenWeather's GeoCoding and OneCall API's, users can input a city into the search form and find a cities current date, current weather conditions, as well as a 5-day forecast.

The search history contains buttons of previously searched cities through the use of local storage. Each button can be clicked to render the city's weather. 
Refreshing or coming back to the page, will also display the last searched city's weather.

The UV Index Display will also dynamically respond to UV conditions.
